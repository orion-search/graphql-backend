            Orion is an open-source tool to monitor and measure progress in
            science. Orion depends on a flexible data collection, enrichment,
            and analysis system that enables users to create and explore
            research databases.
          </p>
          <p>
            Orion also has a semantic search engine that enables researchers to
            retrieve relevant cuts of the rich and content-specific database
            they created. Users can query Orion with anything between one or two
            words (for example, gene editing) and a blogpost they read online.
          </p>
        </Column>
        <Column alignSelf={"normal"}>
          <p>
            Orion uses state-of-the-art machine learning methods to find a
            numerical representation of the usersâ€™ query and search for its
            closest matches in a high-dimensional, academic publication space.
          </p>
          <p>
            This flexibility can be powerful; researchers can query Orion with
            an abstract of their previous work, policymakers could use a news
            article or the executive the summary of a white paper.
