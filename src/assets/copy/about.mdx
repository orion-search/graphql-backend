## About Orion Search

Knowledge and meta-knowledge are fragmented across databases, making it
difficult to spot gaps and opportunities in research, track interesting topics
and read the most relevant literature. Orion changes that by combining data
visualisation with machine learning to analyse academic publications and
enable interactive searches.
Orion is a research measurement and discovery tool that enables you to visually explore the scientific landscape and interactively search for relevant publications.

Orion was supported by funding from [Mozilla](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/).

### Information-rich, domain-specific explorations

Orion combines data from a variety of sources and was designed for visual exploration and discovery.

### Search

Orion combines a semantic search model with a traditional keyword search engine. Users can query Orion with anything from a keyword or phrase to entire paragraphs of text and Orion's ML-powered search engine will find semantically similar academic publications.

### It's flexible

Orion indexes [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/) papers but it can be deployed for any field of study, journal or conference.

### It's open-source

Orion's code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/orion-search). If you plan to reuse Orion in your projects, let us know what you're up to!
