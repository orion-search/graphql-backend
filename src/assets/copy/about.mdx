## About Orion Search

Orion is a platform to illuminate the science behind the science and accelerate knowledge discovery. It enables users 
to monitor progress in science, visually explore the scientific landscape and search for relevant publications. Orion 
shows papers from [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/) but it can index publications from any conference, journal or thematic 
topic found on [Microsoft Academic](https://academic.microsoft.com/home).  

Orion is [open-source](https://github.com/orion-search) was supported by funding from [Mozilla](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/).  

If you want to learn more about it or would like to see Orion for another scientific domain, [get in touch](kostas@mozillafoundation.org)!
